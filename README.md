This project is a React-based interactive dashboard that simulates the impact of different US tax rates on key economic indicators over a 10-year period. The dashboard allows users to adjust the federal income tax rate, corporate tax rate, and capital gains tax rate using sliders. The simulation then projects how these changes might affect government revenue, economic growth, tax compliance, and economic mobility.
